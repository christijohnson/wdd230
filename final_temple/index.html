        <h3>Logan Utah Temple</h3>
        <img src="images/temple-logan-utah-main.jpg" width="500" alt="Logan Temple">
        <p>The Logan Utah Temple stands prominently on an elevated terrace - visible for miles
            throughout Utah's Cache Valley.  Occupying an entire city block, the site features
            charming gardens and an oval reflecting pool on the east side and a huge grassy hill
            on the west.  Just two blocks from the temple is the historic Logan Tabernacle, located
            on highly traveled Highway 91.</p>
        <p>The Logan Utah Temple was the second dedicated temple in operation and was announced on
            October 6, 1876.  The site was dedicated on May 18, 1877 by Orson Pratt and the temple was
            dedicated May 17, 1884 by President John Taylor.  In 1976 the Logan Utah Temple was closed
            for over two years for a complete reconstruction of the interior and was rededicated March 13, 1979
            by President Spencer W. Kimball.  The Logan Utah Temple was the first temple built with
            progressive-style muraled ordinance rooms for live-acting presentation of the endowment ceremony
            which was replaced with equipment for motion-picture presentation of the endowment during
            the 1976-1979 reconstruction.</p>
        <em>"There exists a righteous unity between the temple and the home.  Understanding the eternal
            nature of the temple will draw you to your family; understanding the eternal nature of
            the family will draw you to the temple."</em>
