            <h3>Persona 1 -- 4th generation store owner</h3>
            <p>I am the fourth generation of owners in our family business.  I grew up in this
                community as did my parents and my grandparents.  This community has supported
                our family and I want to continue to provide the service and products that they
                expect.  I have recently graduated with a business degree and I am eager to put 
                into action what I have learned.  I am also looking for ways to give back to
                the community that I love.  I need the chamber to create networks that provide
                opportunites to others.

            <h3>Persona 2 -- New business owner</h3>
            <p>I have always dreamed of owning my own store and to promote products that I love.
                I'm not sure how to build community support or how to find the staff I need
                to run my store.  There isn't any competition for my business, so I know that
                the community will be eager to find my products locally.  I would like to be
                able to hear from other members of the chamber and find out what methods worked
                or didn't work for them as they started their business.
